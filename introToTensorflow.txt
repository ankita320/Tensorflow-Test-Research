**Tensorflow** 
- open source machine learning framework -- building machine learning/deep learning
- can be used with multiple languages - will be using in python
- train and executes models - can develop neural network iamge recognition, natural language processing, digit classification, etc --> after models are trained, they are tried and sued to estimate outputs, and remodel to get better outputs

How it works:
- use TF to create structures of dataflow graphs with nodes in well definited order --> used for different algorithms and computation methods 
- dataflow graphs show us how data is outputed
- Data feeded : multidimensional arrays --> tensors (contain large amounts of data about any particular topic) --> each connection between nodes is a tensor

Steps/Architecture:
1. Preprocessing: preparing data to give it to the model --> includes data cleaning, scaling, standardizng, etc.
2. Model Building: build model using data, algorithms, suited linear regression functions.
3. Model Training: Train data and run to test how accurate output is
4. Model Estimating/revising: revise model to return more accurate outputs every time.

Tensor Properties:
- Data Types Include: float32, int32, string and others.
- Shape: Represents the dimension of data.
  - defines dimensions based on number of elements in each structure of tensor (for example, in 2-d array, shape would be the number of arrays in the array and number of elements in each array in the array.)
- have operators (addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product etc.)
- Rank/Degree: # of dimensions in a tensor (scalar values like int, string, etc.): 0, arrays: 1, double arrays: 2)

Tensor Code: Code From this Google Colab - Tensorflow Freecodecamp
- creating tensor: number = tf.Variable(324, tf.int16)
- getting rank of tensor: rank1_tensor = tf.Variable(["Test"], tf.string) 
- changing shape: tensor1 = tf.ones([1,2,3])  # tf.ones() creates a shape [1,2,3] tensor full of ones
- Slicing Tensors: 
  - matrix = [[1,2,3,4,5],
          [6,7,8,9,10],
          [11,12,13,14,15],
          [16,17,18,19,20]]

tensor = tf.Variable(matrix, dtype=tf.int32) 
row_2_and_4 = tensor[1::2]
